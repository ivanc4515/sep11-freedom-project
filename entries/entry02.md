Learning Matter.js has been challenging due to the lack of instructions. For the past few days I've been tinkering with Matter however I haven't been able to use it to its fullest potential. Using a [template](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/wiki/Getting-started#usage-example) of code Matter has provided, I've used the skill how to learn to navigate my way around it. Through this I understand the basics of shape design and how to add them onto the world. This method can only get me so far. Fortunately by utilizing my skill of how to google, Iâ€™ve been looking at tutorials and explanations of what different parts of the code do. While looking through the internet I found a YouTuber by the name of [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). They make videos explaining how to use different tools for coding including a  [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urR596FsU68&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bLh3T_4wtrmVHOrOEM1ig_) explaining how Matter.js works and examples of how to use it.
