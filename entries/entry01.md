 I have look at a lot of tools that I might work with. Unfortunately there are so many options to choses from. I was looking at some of the 3D/2D tools to make some kind of logic game. I think I will settle on the tool [Matter](https://brm.io/matter-js/). However my back up plan is to use TypeScript to make a advanced calculator for specific questions in my other classes. For example using it to calculate the molar mass of a compound (Chemistry) or determining the angle of a shape (Geometry). My tool will be Matter and I will make a logic game that involves moving shapes around. Matter dosent have a tutorial but someone made a [blog](https://blog.alexandergottlieb.com/matter-js-the-missing-tutorial-70aafc06b167) about how to start.
